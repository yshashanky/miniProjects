# To start a Kafka producer from a specific path through CMD and then enter Kafka messages in the producer, you can use the subprocess module in Python. Here's an example:

import subprocess

# Set the desired path
path = 'C:/your/path'  # Replace with the desired path

# Start Kafka producer
producer_command = 'kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic your_topic_name'
producer_process = subprocess.Popen(producer_command, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, cwd=path)

# Enter messages in the producer
while True:
    message = input("Enter message (or 'exit' to quit): ")
    if message.lower() == 'exit':
        break
    producer_process.stdin.write(message.encode() + b'\n')
    producer_process.stdin.flush()

# Terminate the producer process
producer_process.terminate()

# In the above code, make sure to replace 'C:/your/path' with the actual path where the Kafka binaries are located.
# The producer_command variable specifies the command to start the Kafka producer using the kafka-console-producer.bat script. Adjust the --broker-list and --topic parameters to match your Kafka setup and desired topic name.
# The producer_process variable uses subprocess.Popen() to start the producer process. The stdin=subprocess.PIPE parameter allows you to write input to the producer, and stdout and stderr are set to subprocess.PIPE to capture the output and error streams respectively. The cwd=path parameter sets the working directory to the specified path.
# The code enters a loop where you can enter messages to be sent to the Kafka producer. The loop breaks if you enter 'exit'. The producer_process.stdin.write() method writes the message to the producer's standard input, and producer_process.stdin.flush() ensures that the message is immediately sent to the producer.
# Finally, the producer_process.terminate() method is used to terminate the producer process after entering messages.
