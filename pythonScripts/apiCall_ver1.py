# To run an API using Python with query parameters and headers, you can utilize the requests library. Here's an example that demonstrates how to make an API request with query parameters and headers:

import requests

# Define the API URL
url = 'https://api.example.com/endpoint'

# Define query parameters
params = {
    'param1': 'value1',
    'param2': 'value2'
}

# Define headers
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_dummy_token'
}

# Make the API request
response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Request successful
    data = response.json()
    # Process the response data
    print(data)
else:
    # Request failed
    print(f'Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}')

# In the above code, you need to replace 'https://api.example.com/endpoint' with the actual API URL you want to call. The params dictionary holds the query parameters, where each key-value pair represents a parameter and its value.
# The headers dictionary includes the headers for the request, such as 'Content-Type' and 'Authorization'. Update the header values according to your requirements, including the dummy key-value pair ('Authorization': 'Bearer your_dummy_token').
# The requests.get() method is used to make a GET request to the API endpoint with the provided query parameters and headers.
# After receiving the response, you can check the status code to determine if the request was successful. If the status code is 200 (OK), you can access the response data using .json() and process it accordingly. Otherwise, you can handle the failed request.
# Make sure to install the requests library if you haven't already done so by running pip install requests in your Python environment.
